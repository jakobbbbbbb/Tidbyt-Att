# Tidbyt-Atb
A Tidbyt app for showing timetable for your local bus stop. 

Version 1.0:
Includes specified bus line complemented with the two next departures. 

Planned features:
- User input of desired bus stop and direction. Difficult to find an easy approach as API uses bus stop ID and not regular names.
- Pushing the app to Tidbyt app store. As of now the display will not be updated with new bus times.
